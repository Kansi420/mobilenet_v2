# mobilenet_v2
mobile net v2 trained using Pytorch on CIFR 10 dataset

mobilenet_v2.ipynb - Tried training model locally on CPU but it was extremely time-consuming. 
mobilenet_v2_collab.ipynb - Trained on collab notebook with T4 GPU which helped model train faster
mobilenet_v2_collab_128_batch_size.ipynb - Experimented with batch size and learning rate, increasing the batch size to 128 which gave better results.
